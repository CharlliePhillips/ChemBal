This will balance chemical equations for you using micropython on the TI Nspire.
I made this to help with my current chemistry class to make homework faster.
It is done only importing math, the TI Nspire does not currently allow adding libraries beyond what comes from the factory and it does not come with much.
This could be done much easier with the ability to import Fractions and with functionality that exists in newer versions of python like string slicing.
This took me way to long, but it works.
